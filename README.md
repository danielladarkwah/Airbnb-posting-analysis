# Airbnb-posting-analysis
This analysis aims to uncover patterns within Airbnb's text and numerical data to reveal insights into guest
satisfaction and potential avenues for enhancing the platform's offerings. Text mining techniques such as
tokenization, n-grams, sentiment analysis, and LDA were used to dissect listing descriptions to understand the
elements most valued by guests. Simultaneously, I conducted a numerical analysis examining correlations
between variables such as price, review scores, and property features. The key findings suggest that unique property
types like campers/RVs and boats yield high satisfaction ratings, indicating a market for distinctive lodging
experiences. Sentiment analysis highlighted regional differences in guests' perceptions, with positive language
usage correlating with higher satisfaction in certain countries. To leverage these insights, I recommend Airbnb
promote exceptional property experiences, encourage hosts to enhance amenity quality, and adopt tailored
marketing strategies that resonate with regional sentiments and lifestyle.
